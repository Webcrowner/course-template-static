            <li>Go to the menu section at the top and click the "Top members" and then browse through thousands of members and select a member from your country and ask them questions concerning anything about the platform and how they generated the money on the platform then you can choose to invest or not.</li>

        <p>This is the most pertinent question "how much can I make on Star-Clicks?".

        <h2>How Much Can I Earn If I Upgrade My Account?</h2>
        <p>As a silver member, you won't earn much on Star-Clicks and the maximum daily earning is $0.11 and the minimum withdrawal amount is $2. So you better set auto payout to a Bitcoin or PayPal account. These two options are available for silver members which are free.</p>

When you want to sign up you would be asked if you want to sign up as a publisher or advertiser. If you want to make money online, sign up as a publisher and if you want to advertise your website, sign up as an advertiser.</p>

        <h2>How to Upgrade on Star-Clicks.com</h2>
        <p>It is very easy to upgrade your Star-Clicks account using any of the following payment systems like bank transfer, bitcoin, Western Union, PayPal but I would recommend PayPal and bitcoin because it is very easy.</p>
        <p>To upgrade, an option is found at the top menu written "upgrade". Click on the button and the payment method you want to use and upgrade would be displayed. Just select PayPal or bitcoin as it is the easy method. If you are using the bitcoin process, a list of bitcoin wallets would be displayed. Select the wallet you are using and you would confirm the withdrawal on your bitcoin account.</p>
